### âœŒ Hello!

This repository contains a project responsible for registering users who provide their ```username``` and ```password```, I have their password protected by hash.

This solution is divided into two projects, one in the **App** folder, which contains the entire business rule implemented and the other in the **Tests** folder, containing the implemented unit and integration tests.

The database provider used is [```Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.SqlServer```](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/ef/core/), for SQL Server.
